# A quick intro to the blog
Welcome to the blog !!<br>
I am an engineer who loves to tinker around different stuff and build new and cool stuff. The reason behund this blog's existence is for me to pen down my thoughts , observations , learnings etc. which can range from politics to tech to biology , but mostly tech. So if that sounds interesting do give a read to any of the exisiting posts !!
